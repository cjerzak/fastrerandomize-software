\title{Compute Hotelling's T-squared statistic in base R}
\usage{
hotellingT2_R(X, W)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix of covariates (observations in rows).}

\item{W}{A 0/1 treatment assignment vector of the same length as nrow(X).}
}
\value{
A numeric scalar: Hotelling's T-squared statistic for that assignment.
}
\description{
This function provides a base R implementation of Hotelling's T-squared
balance measure, renamed with `_R` for clarity that it is the R-based
analog to the JAX version in fastrerandomize.
